# Heavy lifting app!
My intention with this project is to leanr React Native in order to create both a web page and phone apps

As functional, I just want an app that is able to keep track of my progress lifting weights, there are plenty on playstores however the twist I want to make, is that I want to provide webhooks for certain events.
- Start Exercise timer
- Stop Exercise timer
- Start workout
- Stop workout
- Open app
- Close app

The intention is to call any service you want to trigger certain events, in my case I am interested in letting my *Home automations* when something happens so my house can react to it :)

Basic functions to be supported:
- Exercise tracking (weight, time, Exercise)
- Define Exercise types
- Define Exercises
- Define workouts containing Exercises
- Webhooks (REST)
- History and reports
